\section{Heap's Algorithm}

\subsection{Time Complexity}

The significant portion of our implementation of Heap's Algorithm is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  3 def heaps(set, time=False):
  4   def innerHeaps(n, set):
  5     if n == 1:
  6       print set
  7     else:
  8       for i in range(n):
  9         innerHeaps(n-1, set)
 10         if n % 2 == 1: #odd number
 11           j = 0
 12         else:
 13           j = i
 14         set[j], set[n-1] = set[n-1], set[j] #swap
\end{verbatim}

To find the total running time of our algorithm, we'll look at the number of times the following operations are executed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Swaps, an $O(1)$ operation
	\item Comparisons, an $O(1)$ operation
	\item Assignments, an $O(1)$ operation, and
	\item Processes (\texttt{print}s in our implementation), an $O(n)$ operation
\end{itemize}

From the code above, we can count how many times each of these operations is performed, \emph{not} including work done within the recursive calls. To better facilitate our analysis, we will also include the number of recursive calls.

\subsubsection{Swaps}

The swap operation appears only once in our implementation, on line 14. This line is never executed when $n=1$; if $n > 1$, the loop containing it executes $n$ times.

\subsubsection{Comparisons}

A comparison appears on line 5 regardless of the current value of $n$. Another comparison appears within the loop on line 10, which executes $n$ times for all $n > 1$. The second comparison also includes a division for modular arithmetic; we will also consider this an $O(n)$ operation.

\subsubsection{Assignments}

Not counting the assignments that appear within the swaps, a single assignment occurs on either line 11 or line 13. This is dependent on the result of the comparison on line 10.

\subsubsection{Processes}

We only process a permutation in the base case of our recursion, when $n = 1$. Thus we execute a process once when $n = 1$ and 0 times in any other case.

Our total number of operations (not counting recursion) can be represented by the following table:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	$n$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
	\hline
	Swaps & 0 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
	\hline
	Comparisons & 1 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
	\hline
	Assignments & 0 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
	\hline
	Processes & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
	\hline
	Recursive calls & 0 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
